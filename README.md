Data from several stackexchange communities in SQL format 

In this repo there are several SQL scripts generated from data extracted from stack exchange communities.
There are some zip files in this repo.
You should extract all zips and run the create.sql file first.
For the remaining SQLs, you can run in any order.

The SQLs were tested on MySQL database.
